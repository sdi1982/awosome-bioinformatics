# awosome-bioinformatics

**Abstract**: A curated list of resources for learning bioinformatics. Some of this repo resources were collected by [BioInstaller](https://github.com/JhuangLab/BioInstaller/blob/master/inst/extdata/config/db/db_meta.toml) project. You can use [BioInstaller](https://github.com/JhuangLab/BioInstaller) to directly download the source code or database files, or fetch the meta information by `BioInstaller::get.meta()$item`.

**Purpose**:

- Provide some of bioinformatics learning resources for beginners
- Provide a profiling of bioinformatics

**Field**:

- Next generation sequencing (NGS)
- Bioinformatics Data Analysis
